Authors of XZ Utils
===================

    XZ Utils is developed and maintained by
    Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>.

    Major parts of liblzma are based on code written by Igor Pavlov,
    specifically the LZMA SDK <https://7-zip.org/sdk.html>. Without
    this code, XZ Utils wouldn't exist.

    The SHA-256 implementation in liblzma is based on code written by
    Wei Dai in Crypto++ Library <https://www.cryptopp.com/>.

    Some scripts have been adapted from gzip. The original versions
    were written by Jean-loup Gailly, Charles Levert, and Paul Eggert.
    Andrew Dudman helped adapting the scripts and their man pages for
    XZ Utils.

    The initial version of the threaded .xz decompressor was written
    by Sebastian Andrzej Siewior.

    The initial version of the .lz (lzip) decoder was written
    by Michał Górny.

    CLMUL-accelerated CRC code was contributed by Ilya Kurdyukov.

    Other authors:
      - Jonathan Nieder
      - Joachim Henke

    Special author: Jia Tan was a co-maintainer in 2022-2024. He and
    the team behind him inserted a backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) into
    XZ Utils 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases. He suddenly disappeared when
    this was discovered.

    The GNU Autotools-based build system contains files from many authors,
    which I'm not trying to list here.

    Several people have contributed fixes or reported bugs. Most of them
    are mentioned in the file THANKS.
